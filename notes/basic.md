# Basic

## cargo command

- `cargo build`: build a project
- `cargo run`: build and run a project in one step
- `cargo check`: build a project without producing a binary to check for errors
- `cargo build --release`: build for release version
- `cargo run --release`: build and run a project with release version

## variables and mutability

- default variables are **immutable**
- make variables mutable by adding `mut`

### const vs immutable variables
1. Don't allow to use `mut` with constants. Constants aren't just immutable by default -- they're always immutable.
2. Constants can be declared in **any scope**, including the global scope.
3. Constants may be set only to a constant expression.

*Rust's naming convention for constants is to use all **uppercase with underscores between words**, and underscores can be inserted in numeric literals to improve readability.*

```rust
const MAX_POINT: u32 = 100_000;
```

### shadow vs mutable variables
1. We'll get a **compile-error** if we accidentally try to reassign to the variable without using the `let` keyword.
2. By using `let`, we can perform a few transformations on a value but have the variable be **immutable** after those transformations have been completed.
3. We can change the type of the value but reuse the same name.
